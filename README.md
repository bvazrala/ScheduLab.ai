This project aims to create a website that acts as a smart prioritizer/scheduler. Later, we may implement multiple studying and organizational techniques, such as the Feynman Technique, Pomodoro, and Spaced Repetition, to help people (especially students) efficiently manage their tasks and improve their study habits.
